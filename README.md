# DSA Journey 🚀

This repository is my daily coding journal where I practice:

    ✔ Arrays

    ✔ Two-Pointer Problems

    ✔ Sliding Window

    ✔ Problem-solving patterns

    ✔ React interview problems

    ✔ TypeScript versions of each solution

    The goal is mastery through repetition, clear explanations, and clean code.
